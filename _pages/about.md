Hello friend,

I am currently a Normalien and M.Sc. student in Cognitive Science at École Normale Supérieure (ENS) in Paris, focusing on cognitive modeling, neurotheory and AI. I also work as a Research Intern at ENS's Human Reinforcement Learning Lab, where I investigate the computational mechanisms of experiential knowledge transmission.

Previously, I worked as a Research Assistant at LMU Munich's [Crowd Cognition](https://crowdcognition.net/) Group and earned my B.Sc. in Electrical Engineering from the [University of Tehran](https://ut.ac.ir/en), where my thesis on interindividual differences in learning received the Best Undergraduate Thesis Award.

For the moment, My research interests center on computational approaches to understanding human decision-making in social settings, and knowledge transfer mechanisms. Here's my [CV](/assets/pdf/CV.pdf).

Outside of work, I like my friends, good writing of almost any kind, good music and films of all genres, mountains, running, (table) tennis, adventurous trips, and quality tea.

<!-- Write your biography here. Tell the world about yourself. Link to your favorite [subreddit](http://reddit.com). You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any of these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](http://fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them. -->
